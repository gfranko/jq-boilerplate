{"name":"Jq-boilerplate","body":"jq-boilerplate - Build stateful jQuery widgets\r\n==============\r\n\r\n##Description\r\nIf you are not using the jQueryUI Widget Factory to build stateful UI widgets, you might feel lost about how to properly organize your jQuery plugin code.  Jq-Boilerplate uses the Revealing Module Object-Oriented Design Pattern to organize and provide structure to a stateful jQuery plugin.\r\n\r\n##The Revealing Module Pattern\r\nThe Revealing Module Pattern uses closures to allow both private and public plugin properties.  Privacy is very useful when you want to provide a public API while also hiding certain plugin functionality from a user.\r\n\r\n##Notable Features\r\n-Provides a ready-made public API and private methods (All private methods are preceded with an underscore)\r\n\r\n-Protects against multiple plugin instances being created\r\n\r\n-Provides a custom jQuery pseudo-selector for your plugin\r\n\r\n-Default plugin options can be retrieved and set at any time using the 4 completed \r\n methods provided (getOption(), getOptions(), setOption(), and setOptions)\r\n\r\n-Callback function and chaining support are built-in\r\n\r\n-A solution for dealing with the context of the this keyword (all instance properties are inside \r\n of an object literal called self)\r\n\r\n-Common methods used with stateful plugins are included (events, disable, enable, destroy, create).\r\n These methods are blank, since your custom jQuery plugin logic will go here.\r\n\r\n##Getting Started\r\n**1.** Download jq-boilerplate.js\r\n\r\n**2.** Change the `pluginName` and `pluginVersion` variables at the top of the file to your jQuery plugin name and version.\r\n\r\n**3.** Write the custom logic for the `create()`, `destroy()`, `enable()`, `disable()`, and `_events`.\r\n\r\n**4.** Celebrate!","tagline":"Boilerplate code to help build stateful jQuery widgets.
